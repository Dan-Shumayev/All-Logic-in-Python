## **Logic projects will be accordingly tagged, shared and managed via this repository**

## The first half of the course deals with propositional logic, in particular:
- We formally define grammar rules for describing a propositional formula of this type.
    - We'll look at some equivalent ways to describe such formulas:
        * A string of characters
        * A tree-like structure
        * A data structure implemented in Python
